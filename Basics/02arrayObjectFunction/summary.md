# Array
 The Array object enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.
 
 syntax : 
 
 ```javascript
    let myArray = [1, 2, 3, true, 'Abhishek']
 ```
 - JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
 - The first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
 - JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. ie you get a reference to the memory.
